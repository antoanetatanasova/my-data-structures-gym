=== Sort Algorithms ===

=== Bubble Sort ===
We need an index (this is the unsortedPartitionIndex) to traverse the array from left to right. It splits the array into
 sorted and unsorted partition. On
the first traversal it is the length of the array. Each following traversal we decrement the index with 1;
In-place algorithm - logical algorithm - we do not create another array.
Time complexity is quadratic O(n^2)
Algorithm degrades quickly
