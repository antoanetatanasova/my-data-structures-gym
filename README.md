# My Data Structures Gym

Welcome to **My Data Structures Gym**!  
This repository is a personal playground for learning, implementing, and experimenting with a variety of data structures and related algorithms. The goal is to strengthen understanding and skills in computer science fundamentals through hands-on practice.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- Implementations of classic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, etc.)
- Practice problems and solutions
- Well-documented code with explanations
- Unit tests for correctness and edge cases
- Notes and resources for further learning

## 🛠️ Data Structures Covered

- Arrays & Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary, AVL, BST, Trie, Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)
- Hash Tables
- (Add more as you expand!)

## 📝 Usage

Feel free to clone this repo and experiment with the implementations:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoanetatanasova/my-data-structures-gym.git
cd my-data-structures-gym
# Explore and run the code!
```
